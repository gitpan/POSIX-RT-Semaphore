Revision history for Perl extension POSIX::RT::Semaphore.

ER := Eric Rybski <rybskej#yahoo_com>

0.03 Sat Aug 5 13:14:20 2006
	- version 0.03
	- Anonymous sems allocated in anon, shared memory if possible
	  (MAP_SHARED or mmap /dev/zero).
	- Semaphore.xs: allow sem_timedwait under __CYGWIN__ (thx ER).
	  newCONSTSUB implementation of exportables, conditionally including
	  SEM_NAME_LEN (Darwin) and SEM_NAME_MAX (Tru64, others).
	- Semaphore.pm: dynamically build @EXPORT_OK.  POD documents constants,
	  attempted anon shared allocation of unnamed sems.
	- t/: use_const.t modified to drop "no_macro" croak check.  fork-inherit
	  tests for both named and unnamed sems.  01util.t modified to sidestep
	  older Test::More installations.  ctors.t works around cygwin
	  implementation.

0.02  Thu Jul 19 00:45:52 2006
	- version 0.2
	- restructure named and unnamed psems as classes with a common virtual
	  ancestor class.  Calling the "wrong" deallocator (e.g.,
	  $named_sem->destroy) still croaks, but now b/c the requested method is
	  not found, rather than as a safety precaution.
	- getvalue() returns undef on failure
	- SIZEOF_SEM_T (undocumented)
	- Semaphore.xs: check _POSIX_TIMEOUTS for timedwait() and __CYGWIN__
	  for unlink() (thx ER).  General legibility improvements.
	- Semaphore.pm: POD cleanup
	- t/:  corrected *cough* boolean inversion in tests (thx ER).
	  Substantially expanded test suite.

0.01  Sun Oct 19 20:02:08 2003
