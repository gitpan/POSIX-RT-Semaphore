Revision history for Perl extension POSIX::RT::Semaphore.

ER := Eric Rybski <rybskej#yahoo_com>

0.02  Thu Jul 19 00:45:52 2006
	- version 0.2
	- restructure named and unnamed psems as classes with a common virtual
	  ancestor class.  Calling the "wrong" deallocator (e.g.,
	  $named_sem->destroy) still croaks, but now b/c the requested method is
	  not found, rather than as a safety precaution.
	- getvalue() returns undef on failure
	- SIZEOF_SEM_T (undocumented)
	- Semaphore.xs: check _POSIX_TIMEOUTS for timedwait() and __CYGWIN__
	  for unlink() (thx ER).  General legibility improvements.
	- Semaphore.pm: POD cleanup
	- t/:  corrected *cough* boolean inversion in tests (thx ER).
	  Substantially expanded test suite.
