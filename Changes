0.05_02 Wed Apr 10 22:41:52 2013
  - version 0.05_02
  - Simplify Makefile.PL probing for libraries, again favoring -lpthread.
  - Check _POSIX_TIMEOUTS for sem_timedwait() and mov sem_unlink check to
    cygwin-specific hint.

0.05_01 Tue Apr 9 22:07:01 2013
  - version 0.05_01
  - correctness:  _SC_ constants' values were wrong.
  - resource efficiency, portability: unshared anonymous sems no longer
    allocated in shared memory. Should support BSD variants that offer
    sem_init but not when pshared. sem_destroy unshared anon sems during
    DESTROY.
  - portability:  Makefile.PL probes for linking with EU::CB, replacing
    hints/.  libpthread favored over librt, fixing linkage on single-
    threaded perl on linux.  Use -pthread (not -lpthread) with gcc.
    Supply MM prereqs.
  - Semaphore.xs, .pm: Move @EXPORT_OK to XS, move DESTROY to subclasses,
    separately wrap dtors for thread-safety.
  - t/:  Add 00-load.t, remove deprecation warning from can.t, update
    use_consts.t for correctness and usefulness, rename 01-util.t.

0.05 Thu May 21 20:48:11 2009
  - version 0.05
  - portability: ppport.h updated to perl-5.10, Makefile.PL favors librt
    by default, hints/ files updated appropriately; this should fix
    linking on FreeBSD and Solaris (thx BV).
  - Semaphore.xs:  use HAVE_SEM_* defines to determine feature set, as
    Makefile.PL now searches for actually present functions (nod to
    Net-Pcap).  Export _SC constants.
  - Semaphore.pm/POD: Note FreeBSD 14 character name limit, correct
    NSEMS typo, document _SC constants.
  - t/: verify _SC macro export, use shorter semaphore names (thx BV),
    accomodate Darwin's ENOSYS sem_getvalue().

0.04 Sun Aug 7 00:40:43 2006
  - version 0.04
  - Semaphore.pm: Update CAVEATs with portability concerns.  Remove
    debugging prints from 0.03.
  - t/: util.pl accomodates dec_osf name choice.  No lingering named psems
    on system.  fork-* silence child's Test::More output.  skip-count
    cleanup following much varied ENOSYS exposure.  Beware SIGSYS, though.
  - hints/:  Initial hints dir:  solaris, hpux and dec_osf support.

0.03 Sat Aug 5 13:14:20 2006
  - version 0.03
  - Anonymous sems allocated in anon, shared memory if possible
    (MAP_SHARED or mmap /dev/zero).
  - Semaphore.xs: allow sem_timedwait under __CYGWIN__ (thx ER).
    newCONSTSUB implementation of exportables, conditionally including
    SEM_NAME_LEN (Darwin) and SEM_NAME_MAX (Tru64, others).
  - Semaphore.pm: dynamically build @EXPORT_OK.  POD documents constants,
    attempted anon shared allocation of unnamed sems.
  - t/: use_const.t modified to drop "no_macro" croak check.  fork-inherit
    tests for both named and unnamed sems.  01util.t modified to sidestep
    older Test::More installations.  ctors.t works around cygwin
    implementation.

0.02  Thu Jul 19 00:45:52 2006
  - version 0.2
  - restructure named and unnamed psems as classes with a common virtual
    ancestor class.  Calling the "wrong" deallocator (e.g.,
    $named_sem->destroy) still croaks, but now b/c the requested method is
    not found, rather than as a safety precaution.
  - getvalue() returns undef on failure
  - SIZEOF_SEM_T (undocumented)
  - Semaphore.xs: check _POSIX_TIMEOUTS for timedwait() and __CYGWIN__
    for unlink() (thx ER).  General legibility improvements.
  - Semaphore.pm: POD cleanup
  - t/:  corrected *cough* boolean inversion in tests (thx ER).
    Substantially expanded test suite.

0.01  Sun Oct 19 20:02:08 2003
  - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
    -cn POSIX::RT::Semaphore
